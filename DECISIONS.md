# Decisions

Dated log of agreed decisions. Newest at the bottom. A decision is the only
thing that makes a statement "true" for this project; concept documents
elaborate decisions, they never precede them.

Format: `D-NNN` — date — title — decision — rationale — consequences.

## D-001 — 2026-08-27 — This repository is planning only

**Decision.** `ecosystem/` contains Markdown only: vision, decisions, concept
documents, analyses of existing repositories. No source code, prototypes, or
scaffolding until the concept is aligned and a separate implementation plan
says so.

**Rationale.** Planning is the critical phase. Implementing before the concept
is agreed produces the same context-loss failure at project scale that large
plans produce at agent scale.

**Consequences.** Every conversation that reaches agreement updates these
files. `AGENTS.md` encodes the rules.

## D-002 — 2026-08-27 — The goal is a manager for many agents on big tasks

**Decision.** The new project is a manager: it owns roadmaps, plans, and
tasks; it decides which agent starts on what and when; it verifies results.
It may be part of jackin (as a daemon) rather than a separate product; that
placement is still open (see `OPEN-QUESTIONS.md`).

**Rationale.** jackin already solves isolated execution of one agent. The
missing layer is scheduling, dispatch, and verification across many agents.

**Consequences.** jackin is the execution substrate, not something to
reimplement. Changes to jackin are planned only where the manager needs them.

## D-003 — 2026-08-27 — Plans are decomposed into small, independently verifiable tasks

**Decision.** A plan is stored as a set of tasks. Each task lives in its own
folder with a description of what must be done, references to the source of
truth it must satisfy, and a verification script whose success output is the
literal status `DONE`. An agent is given exactly one task.

**Rationale.** Observed: agents given one small task with a clear verification
are markedly more accurate than agents given the whole plan. Per-task
verification scripts make unattended execution possible.

**Consequences.** The task format is a first-class contract (see
`concept/task-format.md`). The whole plan may remain in the repository as
context, but the prompt restricts the agent to one task.

## D-004 — 2026-08-27 — Independent tasks run in parallel

**Decision.** Tasks declare dependencies. Tasks with no unsatisfied
dependencies are runnable concurrently, each with its own isolated agent.

**Rationale.** Decomposition makes parallelism free; the manager's job is to
exploit it.

**Consequences.** The manager needs a dependency graph, a scheduler, and a
strategy for merging parallel results (open question).

## D-005 — 2026-08-27 — The manager watches the roadmap and acts on changes

**Decision.** The manager runs as a daemon. When the human marks a plan or
task as ready, or task status changes, the daemon detects it and starts
analyzing and executing runnable tasks without a further command.

**Rationale.** The manual ritual — start a session, build a plan, start
another agent, paste a prompt — is the problem being solved. "I say it's
ready, it runs" is the target interaction.

**Consequences.** Roadmap state needs a machine-readable source of truth the
daemon can watch (open question: files on a branch, a database, or both).

## D-006 — 2026-08-27 — termrock is the component layer for every TUI

**Decision.** Every Tailrocks terminal interface, including the manager's,
is built from termrock components. Product-specific widgets are built on top
of termrock, and generic gaps are landed in termrock, not duplicated in the
product.

**Rationale.** One design system keeps all terminal surfaces consistent and
lets a small team maintain them. Duplication already exists in jackin
(`analysis/termrock.md`) and is the pattern to stop.

**Consequences.** The termrock gaps listed in `analysis/termrock.md` become
part of the plan; jackin's duplicated widgets are scheduled for removal.

## D-007 — 2026-08-27 — Research and verification subagents are part of the method

**Decision.** Task execution is expected to use subagents for research before
implementation and for verification after it, in addition to the task's
verification script.

**Rationale.** Observed to raise result quality.

**Consequences.** Roles and skills used by the manager's agents must support
this pattern; the manager may need to make it explicit in the task prompt.
